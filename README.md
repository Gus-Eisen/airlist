# AirList is a simple note-taking app built off the RAMP stack

## Scope

- AirList will have the ability for the user to take quick notes (like a shopping list).
- User will be able to create a task and mark it as done, perhaps with a checkbox or ~~strikethrough~~ text.
- AirList will be cross-platform, not just in architecture deployment, but across a user's hardware installations, that is to say, a user could create a list on their desktop, and it would sync to their Orange profile on their phone.
- 2.0 goal could be able to grant other Orange users the ability to read and edit their lists, like Apple Notes.
